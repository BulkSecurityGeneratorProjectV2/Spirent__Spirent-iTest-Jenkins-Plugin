	<p> This option enables you to define and assign a value to a custom tag.
	<p> Example: Create a tag that holds the build number so that you compare test execution results between builds.
	<p> For tests run against build 54322, use: --tag buildNumber=54322
	<p> Tip: Use a custom tag to identify executions or groups of executions on the iTest Team Server Test Execution page.
